# Plants_Seedling_Classification_Computer_Vision
Build a robust image classifier using CNNs to efficiently classify different plant seedlings and weeds to improve crop yields and minimize human involvement
# Skills & Tools Covered
Image Processing, Keras, Tensorflow, Convolutional Neural Networks, Transfer Learning
# Background
The agricultural sector urgently needs modernization to make plant management and identification more efficient. Workers currently spend a lot of time and effort distinguishing plant species from weeds, a process that is both labor-intensive and prone to errors.
# Business Problem
Despite new technology, accurately identifying and categorizing plant species is still a major obstacle to productivity in agriculture.
# Solution
To develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify plant seedlings into 12 distinct categories.
# Data Overview
Images Dataset Shape: 4,750 images, each of size 128x128 pixels with 3 color channels
<br> Labels Dataset Shape: 4,750 labels, with 1 column
# Final Model Selection
Model 2 achieved a higher overall accuracy of 75%, outperforming other models in classification tasks.
<br> ● It demonstrated strong generalization with a stable validation accuracy trend, indicating consistent performance on unseen data.
<br> ● The addition of extra convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout regularization helped Model 2 capture complex
patterns more effectively.
<br> ● These architectural improvements minimized overfitting, making Model 2 more reliable for accurately classifying diverse plant
species. Business Relevance:
<br> ● Model 2 automates plant seedling classification, reducing the need for manual labor and saving time in the agricultural sector.
<br> ● Enhances precision in crop management, which may lead to higher crop yields.
<br> ● The model accurately distinguishes between 12 plant species, supporting more effective crop and weed management.
